[Live Demo](https://gbotros.github.io/argumenter/)

## What is Argumenter?

Argumenter makes it easy to share feedback✍️, ask questions❓, or add notes on any video📺, presentation, or topic. Add your thoughts or questions exactly when the presenter is making a point ⏱️, so your feedback is always clear and in context🎯.

Turn lectures and arguments into interactive discussions💬: add your own comments, start a conversation, or just keep organized notes for yourself🗣️. Use timelines to keep debates🤯, responses, and ideas💡 in order, and bring together info from different sources🗂️ or videos.

Great for learning, teaching🧑‍🏫, or just making sure everyone’s on the same page. Whether you’re working alone or with others, it’s a simple way to keep your ideas clear and connected🤝.
